🔐 Simple File Encryption/Decryption Tool

A beginner-friendly Python project for learning the basics of cryptography.
This tool allows users to encrypt and decrypt text or small files using classical ciphers:

Caesar Cipher

Vigenère Cipher

XOR Cipher

Includes a Tkinter-based GUI for easy interaction.

🚀 Features

Encrypt or decrypt plain text or files.

Three classical ciphers implemented from scratch (no external libraries).

Simple and clean GUI built with Tkinter.

Lightweight and framework-free (pure Python).
